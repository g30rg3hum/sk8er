## About

### What problem does it solve?

Currently, there exists general platforms (e.g. Facebook, Reddit, Instagram) where skaters share and communicate online. However, there isn't a social media just for skaters and skate culture. sk8er seeks to fill this gap. Think an all-in-one platform for everything skating—from posting your steeziest clips to asking for advice from other skaters on tricks you're struggling with.

_Oh, and it is important to mention that we're focusing on **skateboarding**. Skateboarding is super popular, and there is a very special culture surrounding it, with tight-knit communities across the globe brought together by gnarly tricks done on planks of wood._

### What sets sk8er apart?

While such features mentioned above sound like they're already possible with existing platforms (e.g. r/skateboarding), the intent is to create a platform closely tailored just for skaters. The **long-term vision** is to become a "standard" for the skating community and embed sk8er into skate culture itself. Integrally, this would involve bringing well-known (professional) skaters onto the platform. We want for the norm to be—"hey, check out the recent clip I hit on sk8er."

## Features

This project is still in its early stages, and thus the current focus is to first roll out a web-based minimum-viable-product (MVP) with the following essential features:

- Personalised user profiles
- Content posting (clips and advice threads)
- Comment and upvote feedback system
- Follow other users
- Discovery system (basic "following" feed, clip and advice sections)
- Notification system (e.g. new response on own thread)

Once the project concept is validated, we will continue to introduce new and more special features. Such include:

- Connecting learners with coaching services
- Sharing of skate spots
- AI Form analysis of tricks
- Periodic trick challenges with community voting
- Crew system
- Achievement badges
- Matching brands with skilled skaters for potential sponsorship opportunities
